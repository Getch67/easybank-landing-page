## My process

As always, I began by analyzing the design images to gain a clear understanding of the HTML structure, CSS layout, and the number of React components required. Once I had a solid grasp of the design, I proceeded with the development, building the components step by step.

### Built with

- React – A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Tailwind CSS – A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- Vite – A fast build tool and development server for modern web projects, used for setting up and bundling the project.
